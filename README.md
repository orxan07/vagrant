VAGRANT - DOCKER - NSCALE
================================

## Requirements

- Operating System: Windows, Linux, or OSX.
- [Virtualbox][1]
- [Vagrant][2]

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/orxan07/vagrant.git
cd vagrant
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

### GitHub

```
Run 'vagrant ssh' then set your git config manually, e.g.:
    $ git config --global user.name "your name"
    $ git config --global user.email "your email"
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your email"
    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
(Copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub into your GitHub account: https://github.com/settings/ssh)


```

### Verifying GitHub access

```
To verify that SSH agent forwarding was setup successfully, ssh into the virtual machine and run the following command:

    $ ssh -T git@github.com

If the output is

> Hi <user name>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

everything is fine. If not, please consider the documentation for SSH.

```

### Docker

```
Ssh into the virtual machine and run the following command:
    $ sudo usermod -G docker -a `whoami`
    $ exit
    $ vagrant ssh
Run: 
    $ groups
If the output is 
    > vagrant docker
everything is fine. Done!

```

### Nscale

```
(Requirements: succesfully finishing 'Docker' & 'GitHub' parts)

Ssh into the virtual machine and run the following command:
    $source /vagrant/init
```
go to  = > http://192.168.50.4/


### Double GitHub accounts

```
(Requirements: succesfully finishing 'Nscale' part)

Iâ€™ll assume here you already have keys and their public parts and they are both registered on your github accounts. We need have precisely the following in our ~/.ssh folder 

  config
  id_rsa
  id_rsa.pub
  id_rsa_eu
  id_rsa_eu.pub

where id_rsa key pairs are yours account keys and second one for second user

If you have such a structure you can easily switch between the users by means of the commands:

    $ my-git
    $ eu-git

```
